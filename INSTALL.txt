### GAME RULES:

# Notes
- The game does not support resizing the GUI window.

# Winning the Game 
- Collect all 4 items and defeat the boss to win the game. A "Congratulations" 
screen is displayed along with the score.

# Losing the Game
- Losing all 3 lives displays a "Game over" screen with the current score.
- Lives are lost when the player touches the enemy or one of the enemy attacks.
- Lives can be gained by collecting a heart which some enemies drop when 
killed.

# Quitting the Game 
- During the non-dialogue parts, press 'q' to close the GUI window.

# Controls 
- The player is controlled via mouse/touchpad. The camel will follow the
mouse pointer. Move the mouse to move the camel. The camel cannot be moved 
offscreen. 
- Hold down mouse button to shoot lasers. Lasers do get consumed if they 
destroy an enemy. Lasers are blue. Touching a laser shot by you will not 
decrease your lives.

# Enemies 
- Enemies spawn at random locations from the right of the game window 
every few seconds. Enemies lose health points if they come into contact with 
a player laser.
- Enemies disappear when they cross the left side of the screen.
- Enemies' health points are drawn below their images on the GUI.
- Enemies have different attack patterns and movement. Some enemies attack, 
some enemies do not attack. Some enemies move faster than others.
- Avoid all enemies and enemy attacks. 
- Beware, enemies can appear from the top or bottom of the screen.

# Dropped loot 
- When killed, enemies have the potential to drop either treasures or
bonus hearts at random. 
- There are 4 treasures that must be collected to advance to the boss battle. 
The collectible treasures have a blue outline. Collecting a treasure will 
give the player bonus points. Each treasure is worth a different number 
of points. Collecting a heart will add another life to the player's live 
only if the number of lives is currently less than 3.

# Player attacks 
- The power of each player attack depends on their current score. 
The higher their score, the more damage each attack will deal to enemies.
- Once the current score reaches 200, the player can shoot 3 lasers.

# Dialogue
- Prior to the beginning of the battle, there is a dialogue box. 
The player should press 'z' to advance to the next dialogue message after 
the message is displayed. The player must defeat the boss in order to
win the game.

# Boss 
- Only one boss lives in this game.
- We didn't have time to draw an epic boss, so it's a square demonic face.
- Every few seconds, the boss switches to a different attack pattern. 
- No loot drops from the boss, so you can't gain any lives. 
- Win the game by defeating the boss.

# Scoreboard 
- Scoreboard displays current information of the game. 
- Score: Player earns points for every enemy or boss hit or item collected.
- An inventory system exists in the scoreboard box that tells the player how
many treasures have been collected. Once the player collects all 4 items, 
the boss battle will begin. 
- Invincibility: when player takes damage, the player becomes invincible for 
a few seconds and cannot lose lives when invincibility is true.

# Background
- Infinite parallax scrolling background. 
- Because we're not artists and don't know how to create loop-able 
bg images, some background art may be cut off.
