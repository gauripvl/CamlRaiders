OCaml 4.08.1 and OPAM must be installed.

Our game uses external libraries which must be installed to run the game.

2) make play 

Here are the features we implemented for Milestone 3:
1) The player is now controlled via mouse/touchpad. The sprite will follow the
mouse pointer.
2) When destroyed, enemies have the potential to drop either treasures or
bonus lives at random. There are 4 different treasures that must be collected
when dropped to advance to the boss battle. Collecting a treasure will give the
player bonus points. Each treasure is worth a different number of points.
Collecting a bonus life will add another life to the player's live only if the
number of lives is currently less than 3.
3) There is now a boss battle stage. Prior to the beginning of the battle,
there is a dialogue box. The player should press 'z' to advance to the next
dialogue message after reading. The player must defeat the boss in order to
defeat the game.
4) An inventory system exists in the scoreboard box that tells the player how
many treasures have been collected. 

Here are the features we implemented for Milestone 2: 
1) Player has one life. The player looses their life if they touch an enemy.
2) Hold down mouse button to shoot lasers. Lasers do not get consumed if they 
destroy an enemy. 
3) Enemies spawn at random locations from the top of the game window 
every few seconds. Enemies disappear if they come into contact with 
a laser or when they reach the bottom of the screen.
4) Scoreboard displays current score and number of lives. Player earns +1 score 
for every enemy destroyed.
5) Once player loses their life, the game window clears and their score 
is displayed.

Previous features from Milestone 1: 
1) Player movement: Use WASD keys to move up, left, down, or right.
2) Bounded GUI: The player stays inside the GUI window. In other words, 
it is not possible to move the player's image outside the GUI. 
3) Quit game: Press 'q' to close the GUI window.
