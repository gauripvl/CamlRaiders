// INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

OCaml 4.08.1 and OPAM must be installed.

Our game uses external libraries which must be installed to run the game.

Here are the features we implemented for Milestone 2: 
1) Player has one life. The player looses their life if they touch an enemy.
2) Hold down mouse button to shoot lasers. Lasers do not get consumed if they 
destroy an enemy. 
3) Enemies spawn at random locations from the top of the game window 
every few seconds. Enemies disappear if they come into contact with 
a laser or when they reach the bottom of the screen.
4) Scoreboard displays current score and number of lives. Player earns +1 score 
for every enemy destroyed.
5) Once player looses their life, the game window clears and their score 
is displayed.

Previous features from Milestone 1: 
1) Player movement: Use WASD keys to move up, left, down, or right.
2) Bounded GUI: The player stays inside the GUI window. In other words, 
it is not possible to move the player's image outside the GUI. 
3) Quit game: Press 'q' to close the GUI window.
