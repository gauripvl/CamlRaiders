OCaml 4.08.1 and OPAM must be installed.

Our game uses external libraries which must be installed to run the game. 
1) opam install graphics
2) opam install camlimages 

To run the game: 
1) make build
2) make play 

Here are the features we implemented so far: 
1) Player movement: Use WASD keys to move up, left, down, or right.
2) Bounded GUI: The player stays inside the GUI window. In other words, 
it is not possible to move the player's image outside the GUI. 
3) Rectangular collision detection: The GUI background color changes from blue 
to orange when the player's image collides with the scorpion's and the 
background changes back to blue when the player's image does not overlap 
the scorpion's.
4) Quit game: Press 'q' to close the GUI window.
